    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: <strong>2025-09-27</strong></p>

    <p>
      Shenzhen Paiai Fun Technology Co., Ltd. ("we", "us", or "our") operates the mobile application <strong>Kitten Metronome</strong> (the "App").
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and the choices you have regarding that information.
      By downloading or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We May Collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA, advertising identifiers), App installation identifiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact info:</strong> Email address, if you provide it (for support, account creation, or newsletters).</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> App interaction data, analytics, crash reports, feature usage, timestamps.</li>
      <li><strong>Location data:</strong> Approximate or precise location only if you permit and we state a purpose below.</li>
      <li><strong>Content you provide:</strong> Profile information, messages, photos or other content you upload or create in the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Purposes for Which We Use Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We may use collected information for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing and improving the App’s features and performance.</li>
      <li>Analytics and diagnostics to troubleshoot and understand usage patterns.</li>
      <li>Personalizing content or features where applicable.</li>
      <li>Communicating with you about updates, support, and marketing (only when you opt-in).</li>
      <li>Fraud prevention, security, and legal compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. App Tracking & Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      If we, or our advertising/analytics partners, track you across apps or websites owned by other companies for advertising or measurement purposes,
      we will request your permission via Apple's AppTrackingTransparency prompt before doing so. You may see a system prompt asking whether you allow tracking.
    </p>
    <p class="small">If you decline tracking at the system prompt, we will not access the device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) for tracking across other companies’ apps and websites.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services and SDKs</h2>
    <p>We may share data with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Analytics providers (e.g., crash reporting, usage analytics)</li>
      <li>Advertising networks and ad measurement companies (only if you consent where required)</li>
      <li>Cloud hosting and backend providers</li>
      <li>Payment processors (if you purchase in-app goods)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">Third parties may collect information directly from your device independent of us. Check their privacy policies for details.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide the App and fulfill the purposes described in this policy, and to comply with legal obligations. Retention periods vary by data type and purpose; if you want details about retention for a specific data category, contact us (see section "Contact Us").</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is <strong>not</strong> intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights over your personal data (for example, under the GDPR or CCPA), including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Right to access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Right to correct inaccurate personal data.</li>
      <li>Right to request deletion of personal data (the "right to be forgotten").</li>
      <li>Right to restrict or object to certain processing.</li>
      <li>Right to withdraw consent at any time where processing is based on consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">To exercise rights, please contact us using the details below. We will verify your request as required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Information collected by the App may be transferred to, and maintained on, servers located outside your jurisdiction. We use industry-standard safeguards where required by law to protect your data during transfer.</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we process. However, no system is completely secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (for example through the App or via email) and update the "Effective date" at the top of this page.</p>
